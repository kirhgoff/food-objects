Good day, Tehnno!

You are standing on the edge of most important decision in your life. You are standing on the entrance to dojo of Warframe clan "Sons of A.Shwarzenegger". Unknown, unnumbered, hidden in the shadows, but, like our father, finding a friend, grabbing a woman, lightning a cigar, packing advanced ammunition before going for ramble, our clan is ready to embrace you. 

What to choose, make a step forward, to the heat of the battle, to hand of friend, shaken after a strange consequence of incredible survival miracles, or to turn around and go to huge empires of big clans ordinary grayness?   

We are a small clan. We consist only of one Tehnno, name's kirhgoff. And he is Supreme Leader of our family. Only father flies above, the mighty A.Shwarzenegger. Our Supreme Leader rules everything else. 

But he needs his Greatest Architect. The gigantic empty areas of Castle of the Sons of A.Shwarzenegger cry for comforting hand which turn these inhabitant lands onto shining pearl for eyes of the Supreme Leader and, of course, other clan members. 

If you feel like the One who is able to emboss clan's dojo in beauty and colour, write us and Supreme Leader will surely answer you. Tell us about the style and theme you want to make for our dojo. If you want to see the Castle itself beforehand and understand what is to be made, let us know, find Tehnno kirhgoff and write him a letter.

Second position in our clan is very unhappy position of Admiral-General of Sons of A.Shwarzenegger. Accepting or rejecting new members, choosing strategies of research (by the way, our Supreme Leader finished about 75% of research leaving the most expensive and complicated stuff for us, hooray!) - these are the tasks for Admiral-General, in general all the remaining tasks in the clan. If you wish to commit, give Supreme Leader small review of your goals and your business plan.

We will become a great nation! We will put solar yadayada in every dark sector! Our comrades will rule the whole Solar System! Greener and Corpus must die, though they deserve some respect..! Alad V is not the legitimate leader!

Well. If you feel capable of fulfilling strange sense of humor of our Supreme Leader and fulfil yourself's in his, drop us a comment and Supreme Leader will probably answer!
