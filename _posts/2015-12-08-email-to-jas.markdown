Hello, Jas!

Sorry I havent replied you earlier, LinkedIn is not a stable way of communication with me, dont check it regurlalily. I like talking in emails, hope you are ok with it.

I am really happy Svetlana connected us, its great to find someone working in HR to understand how IT recruitmwent works there in Australia. I am getting (or not getting) my skilled worker visa like next pair months (15th of Dec will be three months and we start asking them) and I will start looking for a great job of my dream. Its become really wrong in Russia to live, so me and my wife decided that we want to raise our future child in Australia, thats why we are moving.

Svetlana told me that you are ok if I ask you some questions. I connected to my former collegue, we worked in Australian branch of Deutsche Bank, he really friendly answered my questions, but I still dont understand how it will be better for me to approach the Australian market, get better job. I will be greatful if you tell me something regarding those.

First of all, I need to explain my goals. I am looking for a job of backend developer on Java, perfect if Scala (though I am not that good in Scala), some bank or serious financial organisation with warm and friendly office. I am happy to work 60 hours a week in some critical moments like urgent release bugfixes and do hot unpleasnt job, but only when it is exceptional and is not a company internal rule. I am looking for salary about 150K - 100K gross, but of course ready to chase some good position for less money (or in case of danger of not getting work at all).

1. Main question for me - go find a developer position or chase for some leading role. I ve always been good as a field office, development lead, believe it could bring some additional money, but my main goal - to get a job, so if search for lead position is flawed by some unfortunate reasons (like no one would really want foreigner without an experience in Australia on lead position). What do you think, what are the odds to get team lead position or scrum master in AU comparing to senior developer role?

2. I am targeting at 100K - 150K AUD a year. Do you see that reasonable or that is very rare job or even impossible? 

3. I initially was going to start looking for job from Russia, as soon as I get visa. As soon I pass several interviews in 2-3 companies (like online tests, skype interviews with HR, coding tasks) I will go to AU, rent a place and continue from there. But I ve got an impression it will be much faster and I will get more replies if I am already in Australia. What do you think? How different are my chances to get interview request if I am already in AU or does interest for me as a candidate decreases with distance? I believe I will have money to leave in AU for 1-2 months.

4. I look for posiitons in first Sydney, then in Melbourne. Sydney is winning mostly because of the wheather - I ve been to Sydney and like beahces and the warm wheather, heard Melbourne is much colder. What do you personally think about this, do you like Sydney wheather better comparing to Melbourne or its not a big difference? 

5. I see that job proposals are better in Sydney, than in Melbourne, at least for the type of jobs I am looking for, more positions from banks, saw Attlasian office there. Is it correct impression, or I am missing something here?

6. I see a lot of positions from some hiring companies, in Russia we call them bodyshops. In general I dont see a problem for me to work as a hired gun, but I heard they could seriousely cut the salary getting some percentage and restricted me to work to some other companies if I quit. What are these companies, how big is danger of getting problems with them?

Sorry for so many questions, its really great to have someone to talk about IT work in Australia, dont have many friends there and information is really scarce in Internet. Hope I dont seriousely burden you with them. Waiting for you reply.
