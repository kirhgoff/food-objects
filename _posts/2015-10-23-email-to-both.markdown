Hello, again, Michael,

Your so detailed and warm email made me think that it would be ok if I write you again. Sorry if I misunderstood your politeness :)

Frankly speaking, you words have turned the wheel with my wife and me. We were going to Melbourne partly because my wife has a opportunity to work there as a translater (she got unofficial offer from our friend) but... well, the wheather arguments were crucial. Thats the second grade arguments for us to move after political and econimical reasons. Its so cold in Moscow right now, and its only going worse for next 4 months. Suprisingly for Russian, I cannot bear cold temperatures while I felt pretty perfect in India with +40 degrees Celsium (sure for you thats the funny temperature). And I still dream of Manly beach and that trip with Alexey Sinyugin, we took 200 kilometers to the South from Sydney in the rented car after Tim Blaney advised us that place. Slept on the beach during the night and were scared by nightly sounds. We found at the morning that there were little kangaroos in vast number browsing the forest. I liked your wheather when I was there and, frankly speaking hoped for the same in Melbourne. But I heard about rainy wheather and all that before you wrote me, so that was not suprising. 

And the last day we stayed in Sydney we tried surfing and I was even able to ride the wave, won the parry with Alexey. Listening for a wave going from behind while you are lying on a board is one of the greatest feelings I had.

So I decided to try Sydney as well as a place to look for work. From what you written I confirmed my own perception - I think the best for me is to find work in some of investment banking company or hedge fund or something like this. Anyway I spend most of my career working for banks, and working for exchange now. Thank you for that insite.

You wrote about veterinarians, thats very strange coincidence. One of the reasons after politics and wheather were Australia as a land. We adore little tasmanian devils, wombats (it was a revelation when we found wombats defecate with cubic poo!), quokkas, kangaroos, crocodiles and all the little and big critters there. In Russia I use to camp in the forest quit often, just for the fun, now dream about possibility to go for a trip somewhere in Australia.

And one of the crazy ideas about work in Australia was to become a park ranger (not sure whether it is called that way). But we found close to nothing information about this profession, probably we just dont know how to search. Is it hard to become park ranger for a foreigner? How bad is the salary? Is their work is driving around the forest and doing some nature-saving tasks all the time? Probably you recommend something to read?

I have a strategic plan. During the last years I realised my interest in psychology and, additional to masters degree attempted to qualify as a psychotherapist. I hope to think I am really good at this. My plan is to come to Australia, start working as a IT guy to support family, make several children and when I am old, retire and start making money as a therapist. That kind of job is quite plannable and I am sure it is possible to combine with any other part time job, like being park ranger. At least, thats a good opportunity.

BTW do you know about psychoterapy in Sydney. For me it became very important part of life as I see it (as a client) as a possibility to control my life and plan it consciousely, new experience and new skill to get. Some people do not need it at all, I believe, but for some people it could become a great way to change their life to the best. In Russia it is still somewhat shameful to go to therapist, as people could think you are a cookoo, I wonder how people think in Australia about that, do you have some friends who do this?

Anyway I am still waiting for my visa. Estimate time is two months, hope some day I will be able to buy you a beer and talk about old days in Deutsche Bank and thank you for helping me. Its really hard to find something about life from real people in Australia and I am very greatful you wrote me back.

Kirill
