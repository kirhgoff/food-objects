Hello Michael,

Again, sorry for bothering you. All this hell in my country and my desire to do some sceince work in psychology (I got masters degree and learned to be a gestalt therapist) caused me to look for warmer place to live and start a family with my wife. I am waiting for the desicion on my skilled worker visa now (IT developer).

I was trying to reach Ian Pollard from DB, we became great friends those days, but I haven't seen him for 5 years and his DB email is not working, I was going to write to their HR. Anyway, I thought you also can help me with some questions I cannot find answers for or at least some understanding regarding Australia's IT.

1. Most of the jobs I see are in Sydney (100K to 150K in seek.com.au is 150 for Sydney and 100 for Melbourne). Is it really like this, do Melbourne have less IT offices? We were going to go Melbourne as we beliebe the life there is cheaper, community is more modern and young, wheather is more suitable ... At least that's what we got from internet. What is Melbourn comparing to Sydney regarding IT life and job opportunities?

2. I understand that hiring someone from abroad is not an easy thing. I would think twice before hiring someone from Germany to come here in Russia and work. I wonder what do you think, what is the difficulty for company from Australia to hire someone from abroad? Should I have any specific skills or framework? What companies easily hire people from abroad?

3. Do you know any famous IT companies that have offices in Melbourne or Sydney? I found only office of Atlassian in Sydney, but there should be big IT industries, what are the famouse companies in Australia, which make interesting things and go further? If you are teenager again, where would you go for work?

4. I really tried to change my life and go for science work, going to publish my dissertation. My ideal is to work for science lab and implement their models, it would be great to find some science laboratory and work for it for good money, of course. Do you know any superlabs that hire developers to create an artificial life in Australia?

5. I checked the jobs and positions and I am looking to jobs between 100K and 150K AUD gross. As I understood, this will give me 70K to 100K AUD for life after tax(is it correct?). How hard for a specialist of appropriate level to get position for that salary? Is it too high for a market? I am not a miracle, but I hope to believe I am kind of solid specialist in the area of calculating grids, from support tools to software architecture. Is 150K a lot for guys like me? 

6. I understand that best salaries are provided by the banks and financial organisations. Do you think there are Melbourne-located banks or things of that kind? Or Sydney is financial center of Australia? 

7. In Melbourne (mostly in seek.com.au) I see a lot of positions from big recruitment companies. They look like body shops, when their hire you and sell to other companies, mswapping you if needed. How good are they and are these can pay you 100-150K?

Sorry if my e-mail is long and I'm overwhelming you with information, but I'm very motivated to find a good place with good money to provide for my family and have a decent life in Australia. I would be happy if you could send at least some lines to me on the subject. 

Kirill

P.S. Thank you again for oysters, I never tried them before and since :)
